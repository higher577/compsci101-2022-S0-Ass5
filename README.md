Inspired by a university project. This version was reimplemented independently.

Worked with python on IDLE.

Next, the python program first reads a list of colours from a palette text file and creates a colours dictionary. Then reads lines of characters from a pattern text file and draws a grid of coloured rectangles based on the information stored in the text file. 
Each row of the picture corresponds to a line in the file, and each rectangle along the row corresponds to a character in the line.
Then the program displays a pixel art.

When the program is executed, the prompt will ask to "Enter a name:"
The user will type the name of the txt file name of the pixel pattern. e.g.: "frisky"
The palette text file need to have the same name of the pixel pattern + "_palette.txt"

The code needs a palette text file and a pixel picture pattern drawn with palette symbols in a txt file.

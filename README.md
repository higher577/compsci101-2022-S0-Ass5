This assignment first reads a list of colours from a palette text file and creates a colours dictionary.
Next, your program reads lines of characters from a pattern text file and draws a grid of coloured rectangles based on the information stored in the text file. 
Each row of the picture corresponds to a line in the file, and each rectangle along the row corresponds to a character in the line.
